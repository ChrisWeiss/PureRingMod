# PureRingMod
A Eurorack ring modulator.

1:  Balanced input suitable for a SM58 
2: Carrier and Mod levels should accept 10Vpp.   Level controls on each.
3: Mixer on Mic in and Carrier
4: Mixer on the output of the ring mod chip and Carrier in.  This allows the uint to act as a mic input to eurorack
5: Gain control on the output stage, I found this useful to avoid clipping on the output
6: Dual output sockets.  It's a bugbear of mine that more modules don't have dual output to avoid having to use a splitter module to send the signal to more than one output.
